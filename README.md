# Leetcode-Biweekly-Contest
Biweekly Contest 118
LeetCode Biweekly Contest 118 consists of four problems. Here are the problem statements:

Problem 1 - Maximum Subsequence Sum with One Deletion: Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence with at most one element deletion. You can delete one element from the array to maximize the sum of the remaining elements 1.

Problem 2 - Find the Shortest Superstring: Given an array of strings, find the shortest string that contains each string in the array as a substring. You can assume that no two strings in the array are equal 1.

Problem 3 - Find Maximum Non-decreasing Array Length: Given an array of integers, you can perform any number of operations, where each operation involves selecting a subarray of the array and replacing it with the sum of its elements. Return the maximum length of a non-decreasing array that can be made after applying operations 1.

Problem 4 - Minimum Possible Integer After at Most K Adjacent Swaps On Digits: Given a string num representing the digits of a very large integer and an integer k, you can swap any two adjacent digits of the integer at most k times. Return the minimum integer you can obtain also as a string 1.



# Approach


* Understand the problem: Before you start coding, make sure you understand the problem statement and the constraints. Read the problem statement carefully and try to identify the input and output formats, the edge cases, and the constraints.

* Come up with a plan: Once you understand the problem, come up with a plan to solve it. Think about the data structures and algorithms that you can use to solve the problem. Try to come up with a high-level plan that outlines the steps you need to take to solve the problem.

* Write code: Once you have a plan, start writing code. Write clean, modular code that is easy to read and understand. Use descriptive variable names and comments to make your code more readable.

* Test your code: After you’ve written your code, test it thoroughly to make sure it works as expected. Test your code with different inputs and edge cases to make sure it handles all possible scenarios.

* Optimize your code: Once your code is working correctly, try to optimize it. Look for ways to make your code more efficient, such as using better data structures or algorithms.

* Learn from your mistakes: If your code doesn’t work as expected, don’t get discouraged. Use your mistakes as an opportunity to learn and improve your coding skills. Read the solution to the problem and try to understand why your code didn’t work.
